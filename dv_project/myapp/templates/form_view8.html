            <h3>Items to take when leaving.</h3>

            <p>When leaving it is important to take certain items if possible. Beyond this, folks sometimes give an extra copy of papers and an extra set of clothing to a friend just in case they have to leave quickly.</p>

            <p>Money: Even if I never worked, I can take money from jointly held savings and checking accounts. If I do not take this money, my abusive partner can legally take the money and close the accounts.</p>

           <p><b>When I leave the most important things for me to take are:</b></p>


            <ul>
                <li>Identification for myself</li>
                <li>Mine and my Childs birth certificates and Social Security cards</li>
                <li>Money</li>
                <li>School and vaccination records</li>
                <li>Checkbook, ATM card; Credit Cards</li>
                <li>Spare Keys - House, Car, Office</li>
                <li>Driver’s License and Registration</li>
                <li>Medications;</li>
                <li>Copy of Protection Order</li>
                <li>Welfare Identification, Work Permits, Green Cards </li>
            </ul>

        
            <p>If there is time, the other items might be taken, or stored outside the home. These items might best be placed in one location, so that if we have to leave in a hurry, I can grab them quickly.</p>

            <p><b>Those items include: </b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Passport(s)</li>

                    <li>Medical Records - for all family members</li>
                    <li>Lease/Rental agreement</li>
