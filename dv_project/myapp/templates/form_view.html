			<h3> Step 1: Safety during a violent incident. </h3>
			<p></p>

			<p><b>I will not always be able to avoid violent incidents. In order to increase safety I may use a variety of strategies. I can use some of the following strategies:</b> </p>
			<p>
			<b>A.</b> If I decide to leave, I will <b>{{ st.box1 }}</b>. (Practice how to get out safely. What doors, windows, elevators, stairwells, or fire escapes would you use?)
			<p>
			<b>B.</b> I can keep my purse and car keys ready and put them (location) <b>{{ st.box2 }}</b> in order to leave quickly.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>C.</b> I can tell <b>{{ st.box3 }}</b> about the violence and request that she or he call the police if she or he hears suspicious noises coming from my house.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>D.</b> I can teach my children how to use the telephone to contact the police, the fire department, and 911. E. I will use <b>{{ st.box4 }}</b> as my code with my children or my
			friends so they can call for help.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>F.</b> If I have to leave my home, I will go to <b>{{ st.box5  }}</b>. (Decide this even if you don’t think there will be a next time.)
			<p>
			<b>G.</b> I can also teach some of these strategies to some or all of my children.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>H.</b> When I expect we’re going to have an argument, I’ll try to move to a place that is low risk, such as <b>{{ st.box6 }}</b>. (Try to avoid arguments in the bathroom, garage, kitchen, near weapons, or in rooms without access to an outside door.)
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>I.</b> I will use my judgment and intuition. If the situation is very serious, I can give my partner what he/she wants to calm him/her down.
