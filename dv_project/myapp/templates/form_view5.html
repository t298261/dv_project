                <h3>Safety on the job and in public.</h3>
            <p>
            Each victim of domestic violence must decide if and when they will tell others that their partner has abused them and that they may be at continued risk. Friends, family, and co-workers can help to protect victims of domestic violence. Each victim of domestic violence should carefully consider which people to invite to help secure their safety.
