        <h3>Safety and my emotional health. </h3>
        <p></p>
        <p>The experience of being abused and verbally degraded by partners is usually exhausting and emotionally draining. The process of building a new life takes much courage and incredible energy.</p>

        <p><b>To conserve my emotional energy and resources and to avoid hard emotional times, I can do some of the following:</b></p>

        <p><b>A.</b> If I feel down and am returning to a potentially abusive situation, I can <textarea name="box1" id="id_box1"></textarea>.</p>

        <p><b>B.</b> When I have to communicate with my partner in person or by telephone, I can <textarea name="box2" id="id_box2"></textarea></p>
        <p><b>C.</b> I will try to use “I can ... ” statements with myself and be assertive with others.</p>
        <p><b>D.</b> I can tell myself, “<textarea name="box3" id="id_box3"></textarea>” whenever I feel others are trying to control or abuse me.</p>
        <p><b>E.</b> I can read <textarea name="box4" id="id_box4"></textarea> to help me feel stronger.</p>
        <p><b>F.</b> I can call <textarea name="box5" id="id_box5"></textarea> and <textarea name="box6" id="id_box6"></textarea> for support.</p>
        <p><b>G.</b> I can attend workshops and support groups at the domestic violence program or <textarea name="box7" id="id_box7"></textarea> to gain support and strengthen relationships.</p>
