             Victims of domestic violence frequently leave the residence they share with the abusive partner. Leaving must be done with a careful plan in order to increase safety. Abusers often strike back when they believe that a victim is leaving a relationship.
             <p>
             <p><b>I can use some or all of the following strategies:</b></p>
             <p>
             <b>A.</b> I will leave money and an extra set of keys with <b>{{ st.box1 }}</b> so I can leave quickly.
             </p><p>
             <b>B.</b> I will keep copies of important documents or keys at <b>{{ st.box2 }}</b>.
             <p>
             <b>C.</b> I will open a savings account by <b>{{ st.box3 }}</b>, to increase my independence.
             <p>
             <b>D.</b> Other things I can do to increase my independence include: <b>{{ st.box4 }}</b>.
             <p>
             <b>E.</b> I can keep change for phone calls on me at all times. I understand that if I use my telephone credit card, the following monthâ€™s phone bill will show my abuser those numbers I called after I left. To keep my phone communications confidential, I must either use coins, or I might ask to use a friends phone card for a limited time when I first leave.
             </p><p>
             <b>F.</b> I will check with <b>{{ st.box5 }}</b> and <b>{{ st.box6 }}</b> to see who would be able to let me stay with them or lend me some money.
             <p>
             <b>G.</b> I can leave extra clothes or money with <b>{{ st.box7 }}</b>.
             <p>
             <b>H.</b> I will sit down and review my safety plan every <b>{{ st.box8 }}</b> in order to plan the safest way to leave the residence. <b>{{ st.box9 }}</b> (domestic violence advocate or friends name) has agreed to help me review this plan.
             <p>
             <b>I.</b> I will rehearse my escape plan and, as appropriate, practice it with my children.
             </p>
