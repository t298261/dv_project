            <h3>Safety with an Emergency Protective Order, Criminal Protective Order, or Temporary Restraining Order. </h3>
            <p> <p>
            Many abusive partners obey protection orders, but one can never be sure which violent partner will obey and which will violate protective orders. I recognize that I may need to ask the police to enforce my protective order.
            <p> 
            <b>The following are steps I can take if I want to get a protective order:</b>
            <p> 
            <b>A.</b> If I call law enforcement during an abusive incident, law enforcement may be able to provide me with an Emergency Protective Order. I understand that this order will only last for a few days (usually 5 days).
             <p> 
            <b> B.</b> If the District Attorney files criminal charges against my abusive partner there may be a Criminal Protective Order. I understand that this is a temporary order that usually will last only until the court proceedings end, even if my abusive partner is found guilty. To find out if I have a Criminal Protective Order or to get a copy of the order I can call the local District Attorney’s Office <b>{{st.box1}}</b> (phone number).
             <p> 
             <b>C.</b> If I want the continued protection of a restraining order I need to pursue a Domestic Violence Restraining Order. I can call <b>{{st.box2}}</b> (organization) to get help filling out the paperwork. I understand getting a Domestic Violence Restraining Order is a process that can take anywhere from days to weeks so I will make a plan to stay safe during this process.
             <p>
            <b>The following are some steps I can take to help the enforcement of my protection order:</b><p>
             <p>

             <p> <p>
            <b>B.</b> I can although I am not required to inform my employer; my landlord; my family; my closest friend; or 
            <b>{{st.box5}}</b> that I have a protection order in effect.
             <p> <p>
