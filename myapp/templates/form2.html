    		<h3>Safety when preparing to leave. </h3>
            <p></p>

    		Victims of domestic violence frequently leave the residence they share with the abusive partner. Leaving must be done with a careful plan in order to increase safety. Abusers often strike back when they believe that a victim is leaving a relationship.
            <p></p><p></p>
    		<p><b>I can use some or all of the following strategies:</b></p>
            <p>
            <b>A.</b> I will leave money and an extra set of keys with <textarea name="box1" id="id_box1"></textarea> so I can leave quickly.
            </p>
    		<b>B.</b> I will keep copies of important documents or keys at <textarea name="box2" id="id_box2"></textarea>.<p></p>
            <p>
     		<b>C.</b> I will open a savings account by <textarea name="box3" id="id_box3"></textarea>, to increase my independence.
            </p>
            <b>D.</b> Other things I can do to increase my independence include: <textarea name="box4" id="id_box4"></textarea> .
            <p><p>
            <b>E.</b> I can keep change for phone calls on me at all times. I understand that if I use my telephone credit card, the following monthâ€™s phone bill will show my abuser those numbers I called after I left. To keep my phone communications confidential, I must either use coins, or I might ask to use a friends phone card for a limited time when I first leave.
            </p>
           <b> F.</b> I will check with <textarea name="box5" id="id_box5"></textarea> and <textarea name="box6" id="id_box6"></textarea> to see who would be able to let me stay with them or lend me some money.
            <p><p>
            <b>G.</b> I can leave extra clothes or money with <textarea name="box7" id="id_box7"></textarea>.
            <p>
            <b>H.</b> I will sit down and review my safety plan every <textarea name="box8" id="id_box8"></textarea> in order to plan the safest way to leave the residence. <textarea name="box9" id="id_box9"></textarea> (domestic violence advocate or friends name) has agreed to help me review this plan.
            </p>
           <b> I.</b> I will rehearse my escape plan and, as appropriate, practice it with my children.
            </p>
