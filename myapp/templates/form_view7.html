            <h3>Safety and my emotional health. </h3>
            <p></p>
            <p>The experience of being abused and verbally degraded by partners is usually exhausting and emotionally draining. The process of building a new life takes much courage and incredible energy.</p>

            <p><b>To conserve my emotional energy and resources and to avoid hard emotional times, I can do some of the following:</b></p>

            <p><b>A.</b> If I feel down and am returning to a potentially abusive situation, I can <b>{{st.box1}}</b>.</p>

            <p><b>B.</b> When I have to communicate with my partner in person or by telephone, I can <b>{{st.box2}}</b>.</p>
            <p><b>C.</b> I will try to use “I can ... ” statements with myself and be assertive with others.</p>
            <p><b>D.</b> I can tell myself, “<b>{{st.box3}}</b>” whenever I feel others are trying to control or abuse me.</p>
            <p><b>E.</b> I can read <b>{{st.box4}}</b> to help me feel stronger.</p>
            <p><b>F.</b> I can call <b>{{st.box5}}</b> and <b>{{st.box6}}</b> for support.</p>
            <p><b>G.</b> I can attend workshops and support groups at the domestic violence program or <b>{{st.box7}}</b> to gain support and strengthen relationships.</p>
